# SIEM-Usecase
Welcome!
As a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst, I've dedicated considerable time to triaging alerts and analyzing the efficiency of various use cases, including data source assessment. Through my work in use case engineering, I've gained significant experience in refining these processes.

Below, you'll find a list of use cases that I personally built and tested in Splunk.
